# Atlas — Tooling Preview

This directory contains a limited, illustrative preview of tooling developed to support the Atlas OSINT investigation framework.

The purpose of this preview is to demonstrate analytical structure and workflow design, not to disclose full operational capabilities.

## Included
- Example domain-level reconnaissance logic
- Output structuring and artifact separation
- Reproducible, analyst-readable workflow

## Intentionally Excluded
- API-based enrichment
- Full automation pipelines
- Cluster orchestration logic
- Real target data

Full Atlas tooling is maintained privately and can be shared upon request in a professional context.
