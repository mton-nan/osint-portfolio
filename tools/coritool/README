# CoriTool

## Overview

CoriTool is a lightweight OSINT triage utility designed to support early-stage risk assessment and infrastructure-aware analysis.

The tool aggregates signals from open sources to help analysts identify entities that may require deeper manual investigation.

CoriTool is not a decision-making system. It is a prioritization and analyst-support tool.

## What CoriTool does

- Collects OSINT signals related to sanctions, investigative reporting, and business context
- Normalizes heterogeneous inputs into a structured risk snapshot
- Applies transparent, rule-based scoring for triage purposes
- Supports analyst-led review rather than automated conclusions

---

## Intended use

CoriTool is designed for use in:
- OSINT research
- Trust & Safety and risk operations
- Pre-investigation screening and prioritization
- Policy-aware manual review workflows

The tool is typically used before in-depth investigation, not as a substitute for it.

## Methodological Positioning

CoriTool operates strictly within a **passive OSINT** paradigm.

- No intrusive scanning
- No authentication bypass
- No private or leaked datasets
- No automated attribution

All outputs are designed to be reviewed and interpreted by a human analyst.

## Relationship to Atlas

CoriTool is used as a supporting utility within the Atlas investigation
framework.

While Atlas defines the overall methodology, documentation standards, and evidence structure, CoriTool assists with early signal detection and triage.

## Disclaimer

CoriTool does not produce legal judgments or definitive risk labels.

All outputs should be treated as OSINT signals requiring contextual analysis and professional review.
