REG.RU Domain Cluster: Illicit Services Network (Nov 2025)

## Objective
Investigate a cluster of domains advertised on a darknet forum for offering forged disability certificates and illegal cross-border services targeting Ukrainian citizens during wartime.

## Scope
- Starting point: Darknet thread (Aug 2025) promoting fake medical exemptions and evasion of military mobilization.
- Focus: Infrastructure attribution and correlation of seemingly unrelated domains.

## Methodology (Passive OSINT)
- Actor identification via contact pivoting (ProtonMail → surface web)
- DNS, historical DNS, and ASN analysis
- SSL certificate lifecycle and issuer comparison
- Analytics identifier correlation (Yandex.Metrika)
- IP range and hosting provider clustering

## Key Findings
A tightly coordinated cluster was identified within REG.RU infrastructure (AS197695, IP range 31.31.192.0 – 31.31.203.255), exhibiting strong indicators of single-operator control:

- **Illicit activity domains**: Sites offering forged disability documents and wartime draft-evasion services.
- **Masking/facade domains**: Legitimate-appearing business, industrial, and crypto-trading sites (e.g., compressor manufacturing, SMM services).
- **Technical overlaps**:
  - Shared origin IPs behind Cloudflare CDN obfuscation
  - Reused unique Yandex.Metrika tracking IDs across unrelated sites
  - Synchronized SSL certificate issuance and renewal patterns (Let’s Encrypt, GlobalSign, ZeroSSL)
- **Operational pattern**: Diversity in site themes used to camouflage shared backend infrastructure.

## Conclusion
The investigation successfully attributed multiple disparate domains to a centralized technical entity engaged in fraudulent and potentially hybrid-influence-related activities. Infrastructure fingerprinting proved highly effective in exposing coordination without requiring content-level access.
