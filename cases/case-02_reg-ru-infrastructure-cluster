# Case 02 — Infrastructure Analysis of a REG.RU Domain Cluster

## Overview
This case presents an OSINT investigation into a coordinated cluster of domains hosted within the REG.RU infrastructure (AS197695), identified through darknet advertising activity and subsequent infrastructure correlation.

The investigation demonstrates how domain-level artifacts, analytics identifiers, and SSL lifecycle patterns can be used to attribute apparently unrelated websites to a single operator or technical team.

## Context & Relevance
The cluster emerged from a TOR forum post advertising services related to:
- forged medical / disability documentation
- facilitation of illegal cross-border movement
- potential financial obfuscation via cryptocurrency services

Such activity intersects with broader platform risk areas, including:
- exploitation of vulnerable populations
- fraud and document forgery
- hybrid threat and influence operations
- misuse of hosting and CDN services for obfuscation

## Research question
Can infrastructure-level OSINT techniques demonstrate centralized control across domains that present themselves as unrelated businesses?

## Methodology (High-Level)
The investigation applied a structured, passive OSINT methodology, including:
- Actor pivoting from darknet identifiers to surface web assets
- Historical DNS and passive DNS analysis
- Hosting and ASN attribution
- SSL certificate lifecycle and issuer comparison
- Analytics identifier correlation (Yandex.Metrika)
- Comparative domain fingerprinting

All analysis relied exclusively on open sources and non-intrusive techniques.

## Key findings
The investigation identified a tightly coordinated infrastructure cluster characterized by:
- Hosting concentration within a narrow REG.RU IP range
- Consistent use of Cloudflare for rapid origin obfuscation
- Synchronized SSL certificate issuance and renewal cycles
- Reuse of unique analytics identifiers across multiple domains
- Identical infrastructure management patterns despite divergent site content

These indicators strongly suggest centralized technical control rather than coincidental co-location.

## Cluster composition (Abstracted)
The cluster included domains presenting as:
- illicit document services
- cryptocurrency automation platforms
- e-commerce and marketing businesses
- defense-adjacent industrial sites

The diversity of outward-facing functions appears intentional and serves to camouflage shared backend infrastructure.

## Analytical value
This case illustrates how infrastructure analysis can:
- expose hidden coordination between domains
- support attribution without content moderation access
- inform platform risk, trust & safety, and investigative workflows
- complement journalistic and legal investigations

## Ethics & Limitations
- No active interaction with targets
- No exploitation or intrusive scanning
- Sensitive operational details redacted
- Analysis focused on structural patterns, not individual attribution

## Outcome
The case demonstrates the effectiveness of infrastructure-focused OSINT for uncovering coordinated networks operating under commercial hosting providers and CDNs.
