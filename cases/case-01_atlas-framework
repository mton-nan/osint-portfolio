# Case 01 — Atlas: Structured OSINT Investigation Framework

## Summary
Atlas is a structured OSINT investigation framework designed to support
repeatable, evidence-driven analysis of domains and infrastructure clusters.
It combines defined methodology with lightweight automation to reduce noise
and improve analytical consistency.

## Why it's exists
OSINT investigations often suffer from fragmented data collection,
unclear evidence chains, and difficulty scaling analysis across multiple domains.
Atlas was created to address these issues by enforcing structure,
traceability, and analyst-led interpretation.

## What it does
- Standardizes domain and infrastructure reconnaissance
- Collects DNS, WHOIS, SSL, favicon, and tracking identifiers
- Produces both machine-readable summaries and human-readable reports
- Supports single-domain and cluster-level analysis

## Methodological principles
- Passive OSINT only (no exploitation or intrusive scanning)
- Clear separation between raw data and analytical conclusions
- Analyst-in-the-loop: automation supports, but never replaces judgment

## Practical application
Atlas has been used as the backbone for infrastructure cluster investigations
and platform risk analysis, enabling correlation of technical fingerprints
across multiple domains.

## Ethics & Safety
- No active engagement with targets
- No publication of sensitive operational details
- API keys and credentials are kept outside version control
